              <h2>Summary of Culminating Internship</h2>
              <p>My internship at the Seattle Municipal Archives (SMA) has been an incredible experience. I am more excited than ever to embark on my new career path, and my internship has helped boost my confidence and resilience for my upcoming job search. At the onset of this internship, I had four goals: to practice various aspects of archival workflow, digitization workflow, the cataloging of archival objects, and to understand the work environment in the archives. I feel I was able to achieve all my goals and my culminating projects are evidence of that success.</p>

              <p>My first goal was to practice various aspects of archival workflow. At SMA, I worked on two projects that allowed me to experience all aspects of archival workflow. My photo archive project provided me with experience in all aspects of the archival workflow, and the Community Renewal Mao Project gave me additional practice in the description and access process of the archival workflow. Now that I have completed the entire archival and digitization workflow, I am anxious for more experience with accession and arrangement. Having completed the workflow, I know how the first steps of accession and arrangement could have been done better to improve the steps further in the workflow. I would create a document that was more accessible to copy and paste instead of my handwritten notes. My handwriting is only decipherable by myself, and that became an issue. Additionally, I think it would have been easier for me in the access step of the archival workflow and with the digitization workflow.</p>

              <p>My second goal was to practice the digitization workflow. The photo archive project I worked on provided extensive practice in all steps of the digitization workflow, except for planning.   The project was picked for me by my field mentor. They considered my and the city's interests and decided this project would be a good fit. Many others were considered, but when we went to the archive vault, the final decision was made to do the Bike Trail Constructions photos from 1980-200 because the photo archivist felt it fit the timeline of my internship. The aspect of planning that still has me the most miffed is assessing the time it will take to digitize items. I am just now taking the Digitization course, and we learned about tools to help estimate time needs for specific projects based on the available equipment. I am interested in this because I felt the time crunch to complete this project in the given time. Eight weeks in, we learned that the computer workstation I had been working on was slated for removal because of its poor performance. Considering I spent a great deal of time waiting on computer processing, I wonder how a faster system could have helped me be more successful in finishing this project sooner. The time crunch did allow me to consider the digitization controversy of more product less process (MPLP). My photo project supervisor helped me finish my project by going through methods she has used when needing to complete a project in an MPLP fashion. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed metadata creation and ingesting into the content management system, CollectiveAccess. The technology was far less intimidating than I anticipated. I was also worried about digital preservation, but the software and workflow process had that built in.</p>

              <p>My third goal was to practice archival cataloging objects. My research agenda revolves around the cataloging and description of archival objects. This internship has provided me with tremendous experience to help better my understanding of the cataloging process. The Community Renewal Map project allowed me to experience cataloging and rehousing large-scale print maps for the archive and create finding aids in the catalog. The photo archive project also allowed me to experience this. Regarding my research agenda, I learned the importance of subject experts being involved in the process.</p>
                
                <p>My final goal was to understand the work environment in the archives. I was unsure what to expect from the work environment, but I have come away appreciating it more than I thought I would. This term, my mother died. My mother and I were very close, and I have spent the last year helping her and my Dad with in-home hospice care. At my internship, I got the call that my Mom took a bad turn. I could leave without question and be there wholly for her final days. The following week I went back into my internship. The support and care I received from my colleagues and supervisors were tremendous after working in a line career where there is the option to take time for yourself and colleagues who view an absence as a job opening was refreshing. It made me feel more dedicated to work and my coworkers. The archive is where I went to process much more than photos and maps; that is the best thing I learned during my internship.</p>
                
                <p>My biggest challenge has been doing the coursework, which has everything to do with losing my mother and focusing on priorities. I could only budget the hours I spent at the archives and could not seem to muster myself for much of the coursework. Within the internship, I still need to be better at asking questions. It is not that I do not have questions, but somehow, I still feel that asking shows a weakness that could jeopardize my career path. While this is messaging from my previous career, I need to improve. I had questioned how to name something for an access point correctly, but I did not ask when it came up. The next day I spent doing bulk edits correcting something I could have answered if I asked my question. I guess I was afraid of stupid questions.</p>

                <p>My contribution includes digitization of an entire collection and series of over 600 photos, slides, and negatives and cataloging and rehousing a large portion of the community renewal maps. While I did not have the time to catalog all the maps, I hope to be able to come back as a volunteer to finish the project. I have completed the photo archive project in its entirety, and the collection is available online; Appendix 2 provides information on how to access the Bike Trails Construction Photographs.</p>
                
                <p>This internship has had a significant impact on my professional goals. The biggest impact is that I am more excited about potential archival work for government agencies. Digital humanities is still my strongest interest, but how that can intersect with government work seem like a fascinating career field. Government work seems to benefit because it is stable, whereas academic work has many people moving around and jockeying for positions. The SMA people have been there for over a decade and talk about how much they enjoy their work and find fulfillment in it. Having the Bicycle Trail Construction project completed and finding aids in my name will be a huge boon to my curriculum vitae as it provides the all-important evidence of knowledge many employers seek. This internship clarified my goals of working with archives and digitization in that I felt at home and excited about the work in a way I was not sure I would. I am leaning more towards entering governmental archive agencies than I was before I did my internship.</p>

                <p>This internship has been invaluable, and I am so glad I could work with the people at the Seattle Municipal Archives. I was reasonably confident I would enjoy doing archival work and digitization, but I was not sure how I would adapt or fit into the environment. I feel like I met my fellow historical record geeks, which is a beautiful feeling. I love that my work at the archives has already been helpful to one random dude interested in golf. This brings me back to the root of why I am pursuing this career field, connecting history with individuals of today.</p>
